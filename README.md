# Card payment processing with Checkout API

### This is a simple example of how you can accept credit card payments by integrating our [Checkout API](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/guides/payments/api/introduction)

### In this repository you will find two main folders:

- `client`: 
  
    Basic implementation of a checkout and its payment form, complying with the necessary security requirements to collect sensitive user information.

- `server`: 

    Basic server-side implementation, serving client-side static resources and allowing to post collected information directly to our API and process a payment request.

## How to run it

Clone or [download](https://github.com/mercadopago/card-payment-sample/archive/master.zip) this project, move to the server implementation of your choice and follow its README instructions.

If you are programming in a different language, we offer a client-side sample which will allow you to write your own server-side implementation using our [API Reference](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/reference/payments/_payments/post/) as a guideline.
